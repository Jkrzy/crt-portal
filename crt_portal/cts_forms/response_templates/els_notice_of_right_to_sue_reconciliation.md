Re: {{ complainant_name }} v. {{ organization_name }}, et al.,
EEOC Charge No. {{ charge_number }}

{{ addressee }}

The Department of Justice (DOJ) received the referral of your charge of discrimination and investigative file from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  After careful review, DOJ has decided it will not file a lawsuit in this matter.  This decision is not a determination by DOJ of whether your charge of discrimination is meritorious.

This is to notify you that you have the right to file a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e et seq., against {{respondent}} because:

- conciliation in this matter was unsuccessful by the EEOC, and

- DOJ decided it will not file a lawsuit in this matter.

If you decide to file a lawsuit under Title VII, you must file it in the appropriate court within 90 days of receiving this Notice.  If you haven’t already, you may want to consult with a private attorney of your own choosing and expense.  If you need assistance locating an attorney, you may contact the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/filing-lawsuit) or contact the appropriate court, since that court may appoint an attorney in certain circumstances under Section 706(f)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1).

If you have questions or need additional information, the investigative file pertaining to this matter is located at {{eeoc_district_office}}.

Sincerely,

Complaint Referral Unit
