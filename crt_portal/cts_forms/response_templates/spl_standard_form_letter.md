{{ addressee }}:

Thank you for your {{ date_of_intake }} letter {{ record_locator }}.  The Special Litigation Section relies on information from community members to identify civil rights violations.  Each week, we receive hundreds of reports of potential violations.  We collect and analyze this information to help us select cases, and we may use this information as evidence in an existing case.  We will review your letter to decide whether it is necessary to contact you for additional information.  We do not have the resources to follow-up on every letter.

The Special Litigation Section is part of the Civil Rights Division.  The Special Litigation Section primarily works in five areas:  1) protecting the civil rights of people in state and local institutions; 2) protecting civil rights in people’s interactions with state and local law enforcement agencies; 3) protecting the rights of children in the administration of juvenile justice; 4) protecting access to reproductive health care clinics and places of religious worship free of force or threats of force; and 5) protecting people’s ability to practice their religion while in state and local institutions.

We may investigate conditions in facilities operated by or for a state or local government, including jails, prisons, juvenile detention, and institutions serving people with disabilities.

We may also investigate whether people with disabilities are able to receive needed services in integrated, community settings, instead of in facilities.

We are not authorized to address issues with federal facilities or federal officials.

If your concern is not within this Section’s area of work, you may wish to consult the Civil Rights Division web page to find the correct section:  [https://civilrights.justice.gov/](https://civilrights.justice.gov/).

The Special Litigation Section only handles cases that arise from widespread problems that affect groups of people.  We do not assist with individual problems.  We cannot help you recover damages or any personal relief.  We cannot assist in criminal cases, including wrongful convictions, appeals or sentencing.

If you have an individual problem or seek compensation or some other form of personal relief, you may wish to consult a private attorney or a non-profit or legal aid organization for assistance.  There are only two areas in which we can assist an individual or address a single incident:  1) we may be able to assist you if you are being prevented from practicing your religion in a prison, jail, mental hospital or other facility operated by or for a state or local government; 2) we may be able to assist you if you have experienced force or the threat of force when accessing a reproductive health care facility or place of religious worship.

U.S. Department of Justice
