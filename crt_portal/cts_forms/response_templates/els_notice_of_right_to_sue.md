**NOTICE OF RIGHT TO SUE WITHIN 90 DAYS**

Re:       {{ complainant_name }} v. {{ organization_name }}, et al.,
EEOC Charge No. {{ charge_number }}

{{ addressee }},

The Department of Justice (DOJ) received the referral of your request for a Notice of Right to Sue from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

This is to notify you that you have the right to file a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e et seq., against {{ organization_name }} because:

- 180 days have passed since the date your charge of discrimination was filed with the EEOC, and
- you requested a Notice of Right to Sue.

This Notice is not a determination by DOJ of whether your charge of discrimination is meritorious.  If you decide to file a lawsuit under Title VII, you must file it in the appropriate court within 90 days of receiving this Notice.  If you haven’t already, you may want to consult with a private attorney of your own choosing and expense.  If you need assistance locating an attorney, you may contact the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/filing-lawsuit) or contact the appropriate court, since that court may appoint an attorney in certain circumstances under Section 706(f)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1).

If you have questions or need additional information, the investigative file pertaining to this matter is located at {{eeoc_district_office}}.

Sincerely,

Complaint Referral Unit
